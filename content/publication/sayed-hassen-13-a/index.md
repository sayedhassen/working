abstract: 'The cavity frequency locking problem, which arises
in the field of quantum optics, involves matching the resonant
frequency of an optical cavity to that of an incoming laser.
Although this problem is investigated using linear control techniques
for small perturbations, in this brief, we address the
nonlinear control problem of frequency locking an optical cavity.
Models of the measurement nonlinearities inherent in optical
cavities are derived using a singular perturbation approach
and instantaneous bounds are placed on the observation errors.
A convex set within which the error between the laser frequency
and the cavity resonant frequency lies is then determined at each
time step by solving two high-order polynomial equations. Based
on a reduced-order model of the cavity, a time-varying Kalman
filter is designed and simulation results are presented to validate
our controller on a full-model of the cavity in the nonlinear region
of operation.'
