abstract: 'The growing importance of operational flexibility in generation expansion planning with increased integration of
variable renewables has been regularly highlighted in recent research. Yet, operational flexibility has been largely
overlooked in order to reduce the prohibitive problem size that results when operational details at small timescales
are included in this long-term exercise. In this work, we present a multi-objective optimization framework that
effectively and tractably incorporates flexibility screening of candidate generation portfolios in long-term generation
expansion planning. Operational flexibility is considered as a separate objective along with the traditional economic
and environmental objectives. The ability of the proposed methodology to provide valuable insights into the correlations
between flexibility, total costs and carbon emissions is demonstrated using a case study. The results clearly
reveal that omission of flexibility from the framework gives rise to deficient generation mixes that are unable to
match the more frequent and steeper variations in net load. A high-level evaluation of the flexibility needed in
generation portfolios to balance net loads with different degrees of variability is also provided. Finally, a procedure is
proposed to support the decision-making process for selecting the most appropriate investment plan among the many
solution options provided by the multi-objective optimization framework.'
