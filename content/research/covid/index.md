Modeled the COVID-19 pandemic using nonlinear differential equations with a view to better control a potential breakout of a new  variant of COVID or any other virus. In particular,  data for the case of          Mauritius has been used to propose a Model Predictive Control approach to          mitigate its impact. There is room for further work using data-driven              control approach. Please reach out if interested to collaborate/undertake          further studies in the area.
