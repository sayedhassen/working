**[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** is a programming language that is widely used to analyse, solve, model and simulate systems in the field of engineering and mathematics.  It also has various in-built toolboxes which come in handy in various sub-disciplines of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 

A good **Introduction to MATLAB** which will get you going in under 2 hours is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f50sQYjNRA&t=14s):
